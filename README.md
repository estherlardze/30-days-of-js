# Day one/The drum kit project

The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user. I completed this project earlier in my JavaScript learning phase. 

This project involved the use a “data-key” . The “data-key” attribute was then selected using the CSS selector[attribute] method. I found this interesting as this was the first time I had saw this done. I also learned how to associate an audio file with the audio API.
